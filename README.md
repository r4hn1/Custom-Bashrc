# Custom Bashrc

Here is my custom bashrc it will help you while doing a penetration testing,
Will display your ip directly in the terminal.

## Steps to use bashrc
Just download the bashrc from my repo and use it to your system.

1. Change your default shell for user from zsh or sh to bash.

```
# vim /etc/passwd
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

```
# cp ~/.bashrc ~./bashrc.bak
```
